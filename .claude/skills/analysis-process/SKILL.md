description: Turn the idea for a feature into a fully-formed PRD/design/specification and implementation-plan. Use in pre-implementation (idea-to-design) stages to make sure you understand the requirements and have a correct implementation plan before writing actual code.

# Task Analysis Process

**Goal: Before starting the implementation, make sure you understand the requirements and implementation plan.**

## Ideas and Prototypes

_Use this for ideas that are not fully thought out and do not have a fully-formed PRD/design/specification and/or implementation-plan._

**For example:** I've got an idea I want to talk through with you before we proceed with the implementation.

**Your task:** Help me turn it into a fully formed design and spec, and eventually an implementation plan.

See [idea-process.md](./idea-process.md).

## Existing task-master tasks

_For tasks that already exist in task-master._

**For example:** Let's work on task 6 next.

**Your task:** Make sure the task is well-documented and you understand the requirements and how to implement it. Then implement the task.

See [existing-task-process.md](./existing-task-process.md).
